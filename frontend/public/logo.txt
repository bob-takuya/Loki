To create a logo.png file, you can:

1. Open the logo-placeholder.html file in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the logo
3. Save it as logo.png in the frontend/public directory

Alternatively, you can use any image editing software to create a logo with:
- Size: 200x200 pixels
- Gradient colors: #3B82F6 (blue) to #10B981 (green)
- Text: "L" in white

This file is just a placeholder instruction. The actual logo.png file will be needed for the app to display properly.
